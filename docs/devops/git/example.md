## rebase

### Without Confilite file

#### Precondiction
```bash
$ git pl

1d9bcce - Initial commit (65 minutes ago) <Marslo>

$ git rlog

$ git br
  master

$ git push
To git@github.com:Marslo/GitStudy.git
 ! [rejected]        master -> master (non-fast-forward)
error: failed to push some refs to 'git@github.com:Marslo/GitStudy.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind
hint: its remote counterpart. Merge the remote changes (e.g. 'git pull')
hint: before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.
```

#### Merge with rebase
##### Use command: git pulll --rebase
```bash
$ git pull --rebase
First, rewinding head to replay your work on top of it...
Applying: 2: 2.txt
```

##### Check the status after pull rebase
- Check the status

  - The status of meraged file hasn't been changed
    ```bash
    $ git st
    # On branch master
    # Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 1 commit.
    #   (use "git push" to publish your local commits)
    #
    nothing to commit, working directory clean
    ```

  - The branch hasn't been changed
    ```bash
    $ git br
      master
    ```

  - Log added the remote new version
    ```bash
    $ git pl
    7bc54e0 - (HEAD, master) 2: 2.txt (12 seconds ago) <Marslo>
    4e3106e - (origin/master, origin/HEAD) 1: 1.txt (4 minutes ago) <Marslo>

#### Merge by rebase
##### Using command: git pull --rebase

Falling back to patching base and 3-way merge...
Auto-merging README.md
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in README.md
Failed to merge in the changes.
Patch failed at 0001 2: 1
The copy of the patch that failed is found in:
   /home/marslo/Tools/Git/2_GitStudy/.git/rebase-apply/patch
When you have resolved this problem, run "git rebase --continue".
If you prefer to skip this patch, run "git rebase --skip" instead.
To check out the original branch and stop rebasing, run "git rebase --abort".
```

##### Check the status after pull rebase
- branch is changed (`master` -> `no branch`)
  ```bash
  $ git br
    (no branch, rebasing master)
    master
  ```

- Status from `unchanged` and `staged` -> `Umerged`
  ```bash
  $ git st
  # HEAD detached at b9709fe
  # You are currently rebasing branch 'master' on 'b9709fe'.
  #   (fix conflicts and then run "git rebase --continue")
  #   (use "git rebase --skip" to skip this patch)
  #   (use "git rebase --abort" to check out the original branch)
  #
  # Unmerged paths:
  #   (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)
  #   (use "git add <file>..." to mark resolution)
  #
  #       both modified:      README.md
  #
  no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
  ```

- Log changed:
    - New committed version has been **removed**
    - Remote new version has been **added*
    ```bash
    $ git rlog
    b9709fe - (HEAD, origin/master, origin/HEAD) 1: 1 (2 minutes ago)
    1d9bcce - Initial commit (26 minutes ago) <Marslo>

  # You are currently rebasing branch 'master' on 'b9709fe'.
  #   (all conflicts fixed: run "git rebase --continue")
